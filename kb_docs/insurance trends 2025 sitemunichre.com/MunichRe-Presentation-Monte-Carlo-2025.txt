imperatives
A world in flux demands 
strong and reliable partnersCyber risks and
digital threats
Evolving cyber risk landscape 
is pushing the industry to enhance 
models and develop new products.Geopolitical
instability
Global conflicts and new trade
order increase costs for
international players.
Technological 
transformation
AI, automation and data analytics are 
reshaping underwriting, claims and customer 
engagement –and at the same time creating 
new exposures.Econ omic
uncertainty
Elevated political uncertainty is driving 
macroeconomic volatility; inflation trends in 
particular require close monitoring.
Climate change/
natural catastrophes
Severe and unpredictable natural 
catastrophes are challenging traditional risk 
models and driving up insured losses.(Re)insurance industry is challenged by many forces calling for 
thorough risk management

changes
Ageing populations and shifting workforce 
dynamics are driving changes in product

07 September 2025 Monte Carlo 2025 –Transforming uncertainty into opportunities 7Traditional reinsurance capital remains the backbone 
for nat cat risk transfer solutions
▪Munich Re alone has exceeded the entire cat bond market in both 
scale as well as growth over the last years
Cat bond market to fall short on non -peak 
risk transfer
▪Only 8% of cat bond capacity allocated to non -peak exposures 
and only 15% of cat bond capacity allocated outside US
▪Thereby, the cat bond market/the alternative capital is an unlikely 
candidate to close the protection gap, which is most pronounced in 
Asia, Latin America and Africa
Cat bond market heavily focused on higher return 
period events
▪In the absence of a >US$ 100bn peak peril event, longevity and 
reliability of cat bond capacity still untested
▪Munich Re clients can rely on unchanged capacities even after a 
mega event: Munich Re Solvency II ratio still well above 
the upper end (220%) of our target range after a 200y US 
hurricane
